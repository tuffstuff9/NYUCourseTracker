## üìã Overview
This course tracker utilises puppeteer to scrape the NYU public course search via a headless browser for your desired class and check its status. It sends you an alert via telegram when the class opens up. I used this program to track a class for about a month and was finally able to enroll once I got an alert that it opened up. I hope this little program proves useful to you. Please see usage guide below for instructions. 

## ‚ö°Ô∏è Usage Guide

Clone the repo or download a zip and open it up in your desired IDE. Then, run the following command in your root to install all dependencies.

Then, open up ```index.js``` and edit the following values.

To find the course category and number, visit this link: https://sis.nyu.edu/psc/csprod/EMPLOYEE/SA/c/NYU_SR.NYU_CLS_SRCH.GBL?& and find your category.

Then, click on it, and find your class. Copy the number. Make sure you are copying the correct one.

Update the information in ```index.js```.

Then, all you have to do is run the file and pray. 

## Notes

The bot currently checks for a closed class that becomes open. If you would like to check for a closed class that is likely to open up directly into a waitlist, then go to ```scraper.js``` and change the conditional on line 51 to:

I have opted to not do it this way by default because I am not sure if classes even open up into a waitlist, and it is therefore untested. It could cause a lot of unnecessary telegram alerts if it always detects a class rotating between closed and waitlist.
